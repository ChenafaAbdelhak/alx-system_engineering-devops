Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause of the issue was an expired SSL certificate. The certificate had not been renewed on time due to a lapse in our certificate management process. As a result, users were unable to establish secure connections to the server, leading to failed transactions and degraded performance.

Resolution:
The resolution involved quickly obtaining a new SSL certificate from our certificate authority. The expired certificate was replaced with the new one, and the Nginx web server was restarted to apply the changes. This restored the ability for users to establish secure connections, resolving the issue.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:

Automated Certificate Renewal:

Implement automated processes for renewing SSL certificates before they expire.
Use tools like Certbot to handle automatic renewals and installations.
Monitoring and Alerts:

Enhance monitoring to include SSL certificate expiration dates.
Set up alerts to notify the team well in advance of any upcoming certificate expirations.
Documentation and Processes:

Update the documentation to include detailed steps for SSL certificate management.
Conduct regular audits of all certificates used across our infrastructure.
Specific Tasks:

Implement an automated certificate renewal system using Certbot.
Configure monitoring tools to track SSL certificate expiration dates and send alerts 30 days before expiration.
Schedule quarterly reviews of all SSL certificates to ensure none are missed.
Update the incident response documentation to include SSL certificate renewal procedures.
Conduct a training session for the operations team on managing SSL certificates and the importance of timely renewals.


By addressing these areas, we can prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure the continued reliability and security of our e-commerce platform. And remember, always keep an eye on your SSL certificatesâ€”because nothing says "oops" like an expired cert!
